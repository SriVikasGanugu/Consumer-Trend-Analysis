#### SER594: Project Proposal
#### Title: Identifying Crime Spots 
#### Author: Ireish Purohit
#### Date: September 9, 2023

Keywords: 
crime patterns, crime GIS, crime trend


Description: 
I aim to identify the high-crime areas in the city and to indentify common patterns like to time, street, or date. 


Intellectual Merit:
The project can help in discovering different attributes or factors that may influence a criminal activity by generating insights into crime trends. New sources of information like "geographic clustering" could be visualized making the police department, as well as people aware about those "hot-spots".


Data Sourcing:
I have not finalzined the exact data source for the project but I plan to use different public crime databases present online. 
I have found a crime database of Los Angeles which has a crime data from 2020 to present. 
Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

I also tentatively plan to create a dataset by scraping information (reported crimes) from social media and news websites.
