Description:

The objective of this project is to conduct analysis of consumer trends in the United Kingdom across various industries. By examining evolving consumer preferences and behavior this project aims to predict future market dynamics.

Research Questions:

"RO1: To describe the trends within data on how much consumer expenditure increased every year in the UK"

"RO2: To predict the values of consumer expenditure for the next quarter(3months) based on previous quarters(3months) expenditure"

"RO3: To defend the model for predicting UK consumer trends by testing against realtime data(I'd map values of soft drinks in 2023(quarterly)(on the stock market) vs soft drinks expenditure I have from predicting from the data set)"

"RO4: To defend the model for perfroming UK consumer trends(quarterly) by visulaising all categories with similar growth in expenditure"

Intellectual Merit:

It can also help in stock market prediction for products(like soft drinks, household, etc). This would be helpful to identify inflation and deflation in UK. The project mainly aims at understanding data(consumer expenses on various things), with help of this data the project is to build a model which can help predict what goods used by the consumer would be more prone to inflation or deflation based on past data. The project idea was not worked on before and any knowledge presented from the project will be new.

Data Sourcing:

The data source for the project would be the official website for Office of National Statistics UK. Which was last updated on "30 June 2023", which is again scheduled for an update on "29 September 2023".
